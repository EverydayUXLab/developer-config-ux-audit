# Developer Configuration Tool UX Audit

An anonymized UX audit showcase of a developer-facing configuration interface.

This project demonstrates how UX-level improvements can significantly reduce
misconfiguration risk in tools that manage runtime flags, environment variables,
and production toggles—without restricting advanced users or changing backend behavior.

## Focus Areas
- Risk-prone UX patterns
- Validation and confirmation flows
- Safe defaults and impact visibility
- Clarity for on-call and first-time users

## What This Is
- A **UX audit case study**
- A **portfolio demonstration**
- A **backend-safe, UX-only analysis**

## What This Is Not
- A real production system
- A live configuration tool
- Client-identifiable work

## Live Demo
(Replace after deployment)

## Built With
- Python
- Streamlit
